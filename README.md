# C2C Server

## Description

The C2C (Command and Control) server is a centralized system used by attackers to remotely manage and control compromised devices or systems within a botnet. This server facilitates communication between the attacker and the infected devices, issuing commands, receiving data, and orchestrating coordinated attacks.

### Features

- Command execution on compromised devices within the botnet
- Data exfiltration from compromised devices
- Botnet management, including adding, removing, and updating devices
- Communication encryption to secure channels between attacker and devices
- Persistence mechanisms for continued control over compromised devices

## Installation

To install and run the C2C server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/example/c2c-server.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd c2c-server`


## Usage

To start the C2C server, run the following command:
1. run python3 c2c.py


## Security Considerations

Running a C2C server for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical. This software should only be used for educational and research purposes or in authorized red team exercises.
