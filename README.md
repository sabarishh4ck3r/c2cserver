# c2cserver
A C2C (Command and Control) server, also known as a C&amp;C server, is a centralized system used by attackers to remotely manage and control compromised devices or systems within a botnet. The C2C server facilitates communication between the attacker and the infected devices, issuing commands, receiving data, and orchestrating coordinated attacks.
